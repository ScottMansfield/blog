This is a cross-post of my blog post for the [GopherAcademy Advent 2016](https://blog.gopheracademy.
com/series/advent-2016/) series. It's replicated below in its entirety.

--------------------

This was one of those projects that sat in the back of my mind for quite a while. It was destined to
join the many others in my side project graveyard unless I had a good reason to finish it, like a
date for a blog post.

This post is an explanation and exploration of the goroutree data structure. The structure itself is
composed of many separate but coordinating goroutines that make up the tree itself. It has only a
few operations and can't self-balance, but it's a decent proof of concept.

# Example

Let's take a look at a usage example right off the bat:

```go
import "github.com/ScottMansfield/goroutree"

func main() {
    g := goroutree.New()

    boolres := make(chan bool)
    g.Insert(boolres, 5)
    <-boolres // will return true

    g.Contains(boolres, 5)
    <-boolres // will return true

    g.Contains(boolres, 4)
    <-boolres // will return false

    g.Delete(boolres, 4)
    <-boolres // will return false

    g.Delete(boolres, 5)
    <-boolres // will return true
}
```

# Goroutree

The `Goroutree` type is very simple:

```go
type Goroutree struct {
    cmdchan chan cmd
}
```

It only has a command channel to send commands to and nothing else. The `New()`
function only needs to start up the manager goroutine and return a pointer to
the `Goroutree`.

```go
func New() *Goroutree {
    cmdchan := make(chan cmd)
    go manager(cmdchan)

    return &Goroutree{cmdchan}
}
```

# Manager Goroutine

There's actually a hidden "super root" node that takes the initial requests and then forwards them
as needed to the root node. This is to support things like having an empty tree or deleting the root
node. For example, when checking if the tree contains a number, if the root node is null the answer
is always false. For deleting the root node, someone has to be notified of the new root's handle
(read: input channel). The manager goroutine is there to play that role.

Introducing the manager also made the synchronous interface be completely separated from the tree
instead of sometimes requiring a new goroutine to be spawned just to respond to the request.

# Node Goroutine

Each node is a separate goroutine that owns a particular value. It has an input channel that is a
stream of commands which the node will react to one at a time.

Nodes have knowledge of their own value (an int), and several channels:

* input
* parent
* left child
* right child

The input and parent channels are guaranteed to be not nil, but the left and right are not. Each
node is independently and concurrently receiving and serving requests coming in. There's some
situations where a child will message a parent, but mostly the commands go downward.

# Operations

There's three main operations on the set: `Insert`, `Contains`, and `Delete`. There is a fourth,
`Print`, that is mainly used for debugging.

The operations all follow the basic binary search tree patterns. There's no fancy rotations that
happen in the middle, but there are a couple somewhat complicated interactions during deletion of a
node. There's some extra commands that are only used internally that I will show as well.

## Sidenote: types

I created a command type and many implementations of that command in order to send the proper data
around. These are the constant type values and interface for the command type:

```go
type cmdType int

const (
    ctInvalid cmdType = iota
    ctInsert
    ctContains
    ctDelete
    ctPrint
    ctNewChild
    ctExtractMin
)

type cmd interface {
    typ() cmdType
}
```

This is probably a pattern that will make some cringe. I use a `typ()` function to determine the
type of the command instead of doing a type switch. I do it because I like it. There's no real
reason to do it that way over using a type switch.

The command structs are fairly boring, so they are elided for a bit of brevity. They all hold
mostly obvious things.

## Insert

The `Insert` function will add a new value to the set if it does not already exist. In effect, it
will create a new goroutine to own that value and attach it at the proper point in the tree. The
channel passed in will receive a boolean; true for successful insert and false if the value already
existed.

Internally, an insert command message is sent through the tree. The manager will create the root if
needed. From there, the nodes will pass down to the left for values less than them and to the right
for greater until the child channel is nil. It then spawns a child goroutine to own the value and
return true to the caller. If the value is equal to the node's value at any point, it will return a
false to the caller.

The API code to send the initial message:

```go
func (g *Goroutree) Insert(reschan chan bool, val int) {
    g.cmdchan <- insertCmd{
        reschan: reschan,
        val:     val,
    }
}
```

The manager code, which deals with the nil main channel:

```go
case ctInsert:
    if cmdchan == nil {
        ic := c.(insertCmd)
        cmdchan = spawn(ic.val, main)
        ic.reschan <- true
        continue
    }

    cmdchan <- c
```

The node code, which deals with two children:

```go
case ctInsert:
    c := cm.(insertCmd)

    if c.val == val {
        c.reschan <- false
        continue
    }

    // left branch
    if c.val < val {
        // if the left node exists, send it down.
        if left != nil {
            left <- c
            continue
        }

        left = spawn(c.val, cmdchan)
        c.reschan <- true
        continue
    }

    // right branch
    if right != nil {
        right <- c
        continue
    }

    right = spawn(c.val, cmdchan)
    c.reschan <- true
```

## Contains

The `Contains` function tells whether a value exists in the set. This is safe to use concurrently.
The caller's channel will either get a true if the value exists or a false if it doesn't. It does
not modify the tree at all. The internals are very simple, with a contains command getting sent down
the tree until a node can respond definitively.

The API code:

```go
func (g *Goroutree) Contains(reschan chan bool, val int) {
    g.cmdchan <- containsCmd{
        reschan: reschan,
        val:     val,
    }
}
```

The manager code:

```go
case ctContains:
    if cmdchan == nil {
        cc := c.(containsCmd)
        cc.reschan <- false
        continue
    }

    cmdchan <- c
```

The node code:

```go
case ctContains:
    c := cm.(containsCmd)

    if c.val == val {
        c.reschan <- true
        continue
    }

    // Go right if the value is bigger,
    // left if smaller
    if c.val > val && right != nil {
        right <- c
        continue
    }

    if left != nil {
        left <- c
        continue
    }

    // if we get here, the value does not exist in the tree
    c.reschan <- false
```

## Delete

`Delete` is by far the most complicated operation. It has a couple simple cases. If the value isn't
equal it will pick the proper side. If that side is nil, a false will be sent back to the caller.

```go
if c.val > val && right != nil {
    c.left = false
    right <- c
    continue
}

if left != nil {
    c.left = true
    left <- c
    continue
}

// if we get here, the value does not exist in the tree
c.reschan <- false
```

If the value is equal, things get interesting. The node has to figure out how to extract itself from
the tree. In a normal binary tree, this is relatively simple because you can hold on to references
to everything required in one place. In this kind of tree, we need to be able to pull this off with
just messages.

There's three sub-cases here:

1. No children (easy)
1. One child (medium)
1. Two children (hard)

### No children

In this case, the node needs to be able to inform its parent that it will be going away. To do this
there is a special kind of message to replace a child channel. This is where the handle to the
parent node comes in handy. In order to disconnect from the parent node, the child will send a
command to replace itself with nil. In order to tell which child is to be replaced at the parent,
each node on the way down will modify the command with direction it is sending downward. The only
thing left at that point is to return.

```go
// if this is a leaf node with no children, it just returns
if left == nil && right == nil {
    // send death message to parent
    parentchan <- newChildCmd{
        left:      c.left,
        childchan: nil,
    }
    
    c.reschan <- true
    return
}
```

The parent will receive the new child command, which has a simple handler:

```go
case ctNewChild:
    c := cm.(newChildCmd)

    if c.left {
        left = c.childchan
        continue
    }

    right = c.childchan
```

### One child.

This is very similar to the case above, but instead of sending nil as a replacement it send the only
child it has to the parent and then returns.

```go
// one child, promote it to current position by sending parent a message
// we know at this point that one is not nil, so this checks if we have
// one and only one not nil child.
if left == nil || right == nil {

    var childchan chan cmd
    if left != nil {
        childchan = left
    } else {
        childchan = right
    }

    // promote child
    parentchan <- newChildCmd{
        left:      c.left,
        childchan: childchan,
    }

    c.reschan <- true
    return
}
```

### Two children

Ah, this one is fun. In order to remove itself, the node in every case has to find a suitable
replacement. When there are two children, there are two choices: the left subtree's maximum or the
right subtree's minimum. To simplify things, I elected to always find the minimum value of the right
subtree.

```go
// At this point, we need to substitute the current node with either the
// maximum node on the left subtree or the minimum node on the right subtree.
// For simplicity, this implementation always chooses to pull the minimum node
// out of the right subtree.
// The pattern is to send a message down the right subtree to find the minimum
// node. Once it's found, it will have either one child or none. In this special
// case, the node that is found will take care of removing itself and send its
// value back to this node. TO make things simpler, this node will simply take
// the value and assign it as its owned value. I could do some trickery with
// reassigning channels all over the place to physically transplant that other
// node to this position, but that just seems silly to do if I can get away with
// just taking ownership of that value.

reschan := make(chan subtreeMinResponse)
right <- extractMinCmd{
    reschan: reschan,
    first:   true,
}

res := <-reschan
val = res.val

if res.newchild {
    right = res.childchan
}

c.reschan <- true
continue
```

To do this, there's a special internal-only command to find the minimum value. This command is first
passed right by the node being deleted and then left as far as possible. At the end of the leftward
movement, it has one or zero children and can be deleted according to the first two cases above.
This actually got a little bit complicated because there's special cases for when the minimum child
of the right subtree is the right child of the current node. This is a different action than if it
is found farther down the tree.

```go
case ctExtractMin:
    c := cm.(extractMinCmd)

    // The first node might be the one that we want, in which case
    // we need to know. That node will be the right child and not
    // the left like all others
    if left != nil {
        if c.first {
            c.first = false
        }
        left <- c
        continue
    }

    // this is the right child of the node that is being deleted
    // it needs special attention here because there can be a race
    // between the parentchan message below and an external command.
    // The same place we're trying to send the parentchan message is
    // waiting on the reschan, so this special message takes care of
    // both at once.
    if c.first {
        c.reschan <- subtreeMinResponse{
            val:       val,
            newchild:  true,
            childchan: right,
        }
    }

    // then replace self at parent with whatever is at the right
    // nil is fine here, so no check
    parentchan <- newChildCmd{
        left:      !c.first,
        childchan: right,
    }

    // send back the min value for this subtree
    c.reschan <- subtreeMinResponse{val: val}

    return
```

Now in order to delete the initial requested value out of the tree, I cheat a little bit here. It
was probably possible to surgically move the minimum right subtree value into place, but it's far
easier to just return the found value and delete that minimum value node. Then we take the value and
replace the value in the running node that was to be deleted. We move only the value instead of the
goroutine connections but gain the same effect.

While the goroutine is performing this operation it is blocking on a response from the minimum value
search, so no other commands will end up coming through. This should guarantee that we don't end up
in some weird inconsistent state, but like I said before I haven't done any testing for high
concurrency situations.

The final pieces of the delete functionality are the API code:

```go
func (g *Goroutree) Delete(reschan chan bool, val int) {
    g.cmdchan <- deleteCmd{
        reschan: reschan,
        val:     val,
    }
}
```

And the manager code:

```go
case ctDelete:
    if cmdchan == nil {
        dc := c.(deleteCmd)
        dc.reschan <- false
        continue
    }

    cmdchan <- c
```

## Print

The print command prints the tree in an in-order representation left to right, but puts newlines
between each node and prints the number of levels down in spaces before each number. This output
allows visual and programmatic verification of structure of the tree. 

This command is actually implemented as a synchronous printing of the entire tree. The node will
send the print command down the left subtree and wait for it to return before printing and then
sending the message down the right subtree. This means that a print is a blocking operation for the
entire tree, whereas many other operations could be done in parallel, e.g. two Contains commands may
be able to go down different branches concurrently.

The print API code:

```go
func (g *Goroutree) Print(reschan chan struct{}, w io.Writer) {
    g.cmdchan <- printCmd{
        reschan: reschan,
        w:       w,
    }
}
```

The manager code:

```go
case ctPrint:
    if cmdchan == nil {
        pc := c.(printCmd)
        pc.w.Write([]byte("\n"))
        pc.reschan <- struct{}{}
    }

    cmdchan <- c
```

And the node implementation:

```go
case ctPrint:
    // Inorder printing traversal of the tree
    c := cm.(printCmd)

    // make a new command for the children. FOR THE CHILDREN.
    // Each child gets the command and a chance to finish its work before
    // this node mvoes on. This means that printing the tree is basically
    // a blocking operation in which no other operations can be done.
    childcmd := c
    childcmd.reschan = make(chan struct{})
    childcmd.level++

    if left != nil {
        left <- childcmd
        <-childcmd.reschan
    }

    // no this is not very efficient, but this is for debugging
    indent := bytes.Repeat([]byte(" "), c.level)
    fmt.Fprintf(c.w, "%s%d\n", indent, val)

    if right != nil {
        right <- childcmd
        <-childcmd.reschan
    }

    c.reschan <- struct{}{}
```

# Tests

There are tests in the repository to test out all of the behavior in a single-threaded fashion. They
are pretty heavily nested, which is my preferred way of making tests like this. There's one main
test function per external operation (except `Print`) that should exercise all of the different code
paths of each function. They also show how to use it in a few different ways.

# Performance

The goroutree definitely is not a contender for the fastest tree-based set that you could find. With
all of the overhead of passing messages around, it has a lot of context switching to slow it down.
It's actually pretty difficult to benchmark something like this. Checking the speed of almost any
operation is going to depend heavily on the depth of the tree at the time the operation is done. To
at least attempt some benchmarking, I wrote some benchmarks that will insert the same value into the
same tree over and over again. There will be a slight difference between the run times of the first
case where the value is inserted and of the subsequent cases where the value already exists. Since
there's no way to shut down a tree I had to cheat a bit. I also only created one edge of the tree to
simulate a much larger tree.

The output below is the benchstat output for 30 runs of the `Insert` benchmarks. Note that at 40
levels deep a full tree would be holding over a trillion items. I augmented the output with the
number of items a full tree would have with the same number of levels.

```

```

# Future Work

If I do continue hacking on this (or if anyone else wants to fork) there are a couple things I would
definitely consider:

1. Add the ability to shut down the tree. This shouldn't be too hard, just send a kill message down
the tree recursively.
1. Better testing under higher concurrency scenarios
   - Current testing is single-threaded, there may be some deadlocks waiting to happen
1. Rotations to keep the tree balanced
   - This would require augmented nodes and for the depth information to be kept in sync
   - The messages to do this are already in place
1. The implementation could instead take an interface that implements a `Compare()` function that
returns -1, 0, or 1 instead of just using ints.
